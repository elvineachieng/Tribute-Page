     <h3 id="headline">Here's a timeline of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>1914</strong>-Born in Cresco,Iowa</li>
   <li><strong>1933</strong>-Leaves his family farm to attend the university of  Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
   <li><strong>1935</strong>-Has to stop school and save more money.Works in the civilian conservation corps,helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this let scars on me."</li>
   <li><strong>1936</strong>-Finishes University and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
   <li><strong>1938</strong>Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets
        laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he
        returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding
        pest-resistent plants.</li>
   <li><strong>1941</strong>-
  Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.
</li>
   <li><strong>1942</strong>-Receives a PH.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
   <li><strong>1944</strong>- Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont,
        leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant
        pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000
        different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different
        varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>
   <li><strong>1945</strong>-Discovers a way to grow wheat twice a season, ddoubling weat yields</li>
   <li><strong>1953</strong>-crosses a short sturdy dwarf breed pof wheat with ahigh yilding American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
   <li><strong>1962</strong>-visist Delhi and brinhs his high yileding strains of wheat to the indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass startvation due to rapidly exapnding population</li>
   <li><strong>1970</strong>-receives Nobel Peace Price</li>
    <li><strong>1983</strong>-helps seven African countries dranatically increase their maize ans sorghum yields</li>
   <li><strong>1984</strong>-becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&m University</li>
   <li><strong>2005</strong>-states "we will have to double the world food
        supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way
        we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops
        are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying
        plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science,
        people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
  <li><strong>2005</strong>-Dies at the age of 95</li>
